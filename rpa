-rpa Upath studio a tool for building automation processes
_ui path robot executes the processes
UIpath orchestrators monitors the robots
-robots working with humans attended robots, robots working by themselves are unttended robots
    As an RPA Developer, you'll use the Studio family (Studio and StudioX) to build reliable automation processes based on business requirements. 
    Studio, Robots, and Orchestrator communicate with one another in different phases.
    Automation projects built in Studio are published locally or through Orchestrator. 
    Published automation projects are called packages. 
    Attended robots work on the same machine as human users. 
    In attended scenarios, processes are typically started by human users from UiPath Assistant. 
    Unattended robots are deployed on separate machines, which aren't used by human users (often virtual machines). 
    In unattended scenarios, process execution is started, scheduled, and managed from Orchestrator.
